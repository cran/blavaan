Changes in Version 0.1-3
    o Improved support for growth models, including latent variances
      fixed to 0.

    o Extra monitors supplied via jagextra become defined parameters
      in summary().

Changes in Version 0.1-2
    o Bayes factors for loadings/regressions now available from
      summary() via argument bf=TRUE. These are computed via
      the Savage-Dickey density ratio (assuming normal posterior).

    o Bug fix in generation of random initial values when some
      covariance parameters are fixed to 0 (and we use srs priors).

    o Explicit translations from JAGS parameterizations to R
      parameterizations. This leads to the availability of
      more fitMeasures under a wider variety of priors.

Changes in Version 0.1-1
    o Added plot method related to plot.runjags().

    o Added argument jagextra for supplying extra code to JAGS.

    o Changes to summary():
      Improving look and operability with lavaan
      Posterior medians/modes now available

    o runjags slot in blavaan objects is moved to 
      @external$runjags.

    o fitMeasures() now includes BIC and loglik (at posterior means).

    o do.fit=FALSE now works, returns only JAGS syntax.

    o Random initial values less likely to fail.

    o Bug fixes related to equality constraints on mv variances +
      std.lv=T vs TRUE.
